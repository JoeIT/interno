<p><b>MultiPowUpload</b> is easy client-side solution that can be used to perform file uploads from a user machine to the web server. 
  MultiPowUpload is a Macromedia Flash movie supported by most browsers and  needs just Flash player plug-in on users side and any standard file processing script on server side. </p>
<p>In a pure-HTML solution, client files can be uploaded to the server via a multipart/form-data form with one or more &lt;INPUT TYPE=FILE&gt; items on it. However, the form-based approach has the following limitation: </p>
<ul>
<li>The "Choose File" dialog shown by a browser does not allow multiple selections. 
<li>To upload multiple files at once, the HTML form must contain multiple &lt;INPUT TYPE=FILE&gt; boxes, and each file must be selected individually. 
<li>An entire folder cannot be selected for uploading. 
<li>There is no way to specify file filters to be displayed in the Files of Type box of the "Choose File" dialog. 
<li>There is no way to put a limit on the type, size and number of files being uploaded before an upload begins. 
<li>File date information cannot be preserved. 
<li>There is no progress state information while upload.
</ul>
