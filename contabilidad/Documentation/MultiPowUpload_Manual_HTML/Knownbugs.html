<strong>Known bugs and limitations in MultiPowUpload 1.7:</strong><br>
<br>All of specified below bugs and limitations related to Macromedia API and can't be fixed by us. We hope in next versions of Flash player something will be changed. 
<ul>
<li>Due to some unknown reasons sometimes Flash generates "<strong>IO error</strong>" while upload. It is Macromedia bug.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: MultiPowUpload by default tryes to upload file wich wasn't uploaded due to error 3 times.</p>
<li>If <code>uploadUrl</code> parameter stores full URL to script then you need to have <a href="CrossDomainSecurity.html">crossdomain.xml</a> file in root of server.
<li>To upload files using <strong>SSL (HTTPS)</strong> uploadURL parameter should has format like <code>uploadURL=http://www.yoursite.com:443/uploadfiles.aspx</code>. 443 is port of SSL.
 <li>Flash by default dont <strong>passes other Form fields values</strong> while upload.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: You can use Java Script function to pass Form fields values while upload. See example at "UploadWithForm.html" file</p>
 <li>Flash in FireFox browser don't pass <strong>cookies</strong> while upload. Therefor <strong>sessions</strong> are different at page with Flash and upload script.
 <p style="padding-left:15px;">
	Workaround: Include cookies and session ID in uploadUrl parameter like <code>uploadURL=uploadscript.aspx?mysessionID=&lt;%=Response.Cookies("sessionID")%&gt;&mypassword=&lt;%=Response.Cookies("password")%&gt;</code>	</p>
<li>If <a href="Parameters.html#useExternalInterface">External Interface</a> is enabled (<code>useExternalInterface=Yes</code>) Flash can't be placed inside Form tag: Error <strong>"FlashFilesUpload is undefined"</strong> occures in IE browser.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>
<li><strong>Windows authentication</strong> works separatly of browser and asks credentials while uploading each file.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>	
<li>Impossible to get <strong>path of selected or uploaded file</strong>. Only file name available. In upload script FileName property also includes only file name without path.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No</p>
<li>ContentType for all uploaded files is <strong>"application/octet-stream"</strong>.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: Read file extension to get type of file.</p>
<li>Fieldname property of uploaded file is <strong>"Filedata"</strong> and can't be modified.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>
<li>Flash sends files ony by one, each in separate request.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>
<li>Uploading file can't be <strong>stopped immediatly</strong> -Only closing browser window stops uploading.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>
<li>File procesing script (that specified in uploadUrl parameter) should sent at least one symbol to response. Otherwise onComplete event don't occures in <strong>Safari (Mac OS) browser</strong> therefore only first file uploads.
  <p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>
  <li>File procesing script (that specified in uploadUrl parameter) should sent at least one symbol to response. Otherwise onComplete event don't occures in <strong>Safari (Mac OS) browser</strong> therefore only first file uploads.
  <p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>
  <li>Rare bug: If system using large font size (at Desktop -&gt; Properties -&gt;
Appearance tab-&gt; Font size) then method Flash.browseFiles(fileTypes) can cause MultiPowUpload  movie crash.
    Bug depends on OS used and seems that exists only at some localized Win XP SP2.
<p style="padding-left:15px;">Workaround: No.</p>
